# Opening_Shift
# Opening Shift (VR Game) is a virtual reality coffee shop simulation built in Unity. It puts the player in the role of a barista starting their morning shift, where they prepare drinks, interact with equipment, and work in a fully VR environment.

This was developed as part of a college game development project to explore immersive interaction and gameplay in VR.

What This Project Is About- 
The goal was to create an interactive and semi-realistic VR experience using Unity's XR Interaction Toolkit. We focused on building out the drink-making system and making the environment feel responsive to the player.
